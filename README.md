# Running_Distance_Calculator
Running_Distance_Calculator is a tool for estimating the distance of a running workout, given the profile of the workout and the paces of the runner. The calculator allows runners to more easily plan routes to arrive home right at the end of the workout.

Required modules: tkinter

Pros: simple tool for estimating the distances of running workouts based on pace zones and interval times

Cons: currently, the package is lacking checks on proper syntax for user inputs

Future functionality envisiged: toggle box to switch between metric and imperial systems; calculators for other sports (bike, skiing, etc); storage of pace zones for different users; import of workout profiles from garmin/strava/zwift
